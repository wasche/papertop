This is a home grown custom ruleset, meant to fit on one page. The goal is to be
simple and quick, with a focus on role-play and cinematics. It uses 3d6 for most
rolls. Attributes are Might, Mental, and Speed. There are no pre-defined skills,
it is up to the player and GM decide. They can be as specific or as generic as
makes sense.
